1.Is there any possibility to add aditional columns or custom fields in contact list of constant contact? 

2.when using connector first time we have to configure out which fields of crm are mapped to which fields in constant contact

3.start begin with fName,LastName,Email,Company

4.create custom view where there are two emailids the minute pushed to constant contact maintain to keep these emails in crm
when there is new email is created in crm at later time(sheduler) we have to push that new email to CC

5.To create a contact using constant contact api 
once u have creation of contact then what will we do this create contact list using that list add multiple contact 
to this list

In extension create a screen where you will to choose the list of contacts you will give the name for the list 
that you want to create so then using that list name and using that information of contacts you will do both of this
 
In your extension screen to choose which module of CRM for now have a two option like leads or contacts and depending upon 
what i have choose then whether i'm taking all leads or subset of leads whatever custom view and then define the name of 
list that i want to create on constant contact side and then i click ok you should take all the contact from that 
custom view and create a new list in constant contact with the name that i have provided and to that list you should add
 all these new contacts 

if that is done the sync process is kind of setup then we have to figure out for that same list when campaign created
how do we retreive data for a campaign into campaign module crm.
